Given an ‘N’ x ‘M’ integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's, and return the matrix. In particular, your task is to modify it in
such a way that if a cell has a value 0 (matrix[i][j] == 0), then all the cells of the ith row and jth column should be changed to 0.
You must do it in place.

def setZeros(matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    # Write your code here.
    n=len(matrix)
    m=len(matrix[0])
    
    #Memory Arrays
    row=[0 for i in range(n)]
    col=[0 for i in range(m)]
    
    #If a row or column contains 0, then that row and column is marked as -1,so that during the final traversal we can reference to it.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if matrix[i][j]==0:
                row[i]=-1
                col[j]=-1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row[i]==-1 or col[j]==-1:
                matrix[i][j]=0
